0.2.0: 2023 Aug 25

firmware
* fixed: a couple build errors
* added: MODE_SOFT_VELOCITY for sending /s data via midi velocity for /d
* added: soft touch to send function
* added: sending control signals to the next count of panels up. i.e: from 8-15 for Y8
* added: receive handling for float arguments, this improves flexibility when working with pd's built-in osc objects
* changed: OSC messaging protocol for instrument signals /d/0 -> /d 0rg
* changed: volume scaling from input signal from 8bit to 7bits for midi / osc compatibility
* changed: inverted the velocity logic for /s, now 127 is hard and 0 is soft
* changed: send /key and /n with id as a
* changed: check range when setting mode, scale, & root

puredata
* puredata: added oi abstraction library
* added: mode 6 for MODE_SOFT_VELOCITY
* changed: volume scaling from 0-255 to 0-127
* changed: send soft -> send /s
* changed: send bend -> send /b
* changed: ctrlin to numerate each /b or /s signal for clarity in the patch
* changed: various puredata template improvements and bugfixes

docs
* added: pd vanilla setup dependency and install steps
* added: commnication spec info markdown info and diagram
* added: readme sections and changelog
